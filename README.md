Target audience 
Age: Adults between the ages of 25 and 55 are most likely to use online ticket booking services.
Income: Individuals with a moderate to high income who are comfortable using online services and digital payments.
Geography: Urban and semi-urban areas where internet connectivity and smartphone usage is high.
Travel Habits: Frequent travelers who prefer the convenience of booking tickets online and want to avoid long queues at bus stations.
Technology Adoption: Individuals who are comfortable using technology and are familiar with online ticket booking processes.
Essential Features
User registration and login: This will allow users to create an account, log in, and access their booking history.
Search and compare bus routes: Users should be able to search for available bus routes, compare prices and timings, and select the best option for their travel needs.
Seat selection and booking: Users should be able to select their preferred seats, view seat availability, and make a booking in real-time.
Payment options: The platform should offer multiple payment options, such as credit/debit card, internet banking, and mobile wallets, to make the booking process easy and convenient.
Ticket confirmation and e-ticket generation: After a booking is made, users should receive a confirmation and an electronic ticket, which they can access and view on their mobile devices.
Cancellation and refund: Users should be able to easily cancel their bookings and receive a refund if applicable, with clear information about the cancellation policy.
Customer support: The platform should provide 24/7 customer support, either through a dedicated hotline or online chat, to help users resolve any issues or concerns.
Architecture
Front-end: The front-end will be built using popular technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface should be simple, easy to navigate and responsive, to ensure a good user experience across different devices.
Back-end: The back-end of the MVP will be built using a server-side technology  as Node.js . The back-end will handle all the data processing, ticket booking and cancellation requests, and communicate with the database to store and retrieve information.
Database: The database can will built using a relational database management system such as MySQL . The database will store information about bus schedules, ticket availability, and user details.
API: The MVP should have a simple, well-documented API that allows third-party apps to access the booking and cancellation features. This will enable seamless integration with other travel-related applications and services.
Server: The MVP will require a server to host the front-end, back-end, and database components. This can be a cloud-based server such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, or a physical server in a data center
